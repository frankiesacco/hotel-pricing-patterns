# hotel-pricing-patterns
This project aims to analyze factors influencing hotel pricing in an effort to uncover patterns that travelers (or hotels) can use to make better decisions.

## Research Questions
Q1: How does distance from the city center affect hotel prices in different European cities?
Q2: Do higher-rated hotels (stars/user ratings) always command higher prices, or do outliers exist?
Q3: How do weekends and holidays affect hotel prices compared to weekdays?
Q4: Which European cities have the highest vs. lowest average hotel prices?
Q5: Which cities or hotels provide the best value when controlling for star rating, distance, and user score?

## Hypotheses
-Hotels closer to city center will be more expensive than those farther away
-Star ratings are a better indicator of expensiveness than user ratings
-Weekends and holidays see room rates increase compared to weekdays; similarly, room rates increase during the Summer
-Cities with the highest prices are likely located in Northern/Western Europe, while low rates are found in Eastern/Southern
-The best value hotels will primarily be those outside the city center/capital city
